In the directory called promptEngineering, there's a markdown file called ReFlaxPromptTemplate.markdown

For brevity, let's refer to this file as ContextFile. ContextFile provides an overview of the project. Whenever I make a query or request a feature, I'd like the following workflow to be observed (numbered below). Please note that I used the word task to cover any request I make:

1. Read ContextFile and try to understand it.
2. If there are areas that require clarification on ContextFile, ask me before proceeding with task.
3. Once clarification has been reached, update ContextFile and ask me to review.
4. Once I am happy with changed, proceed with task
5. At the end of task, run forge test.
6. If there are test failures, be sure that they are not expected to break, given the current code state. If they are expected to pass, fix the bug in code. If the test is buggy, fix the test itself.
7. Once the task is complete and the tests that should pass are passing, there will likely be changes to source files. If so, update ContextFile if necessary.


I will review all changes in source control. If I'm happy, I can commit. This enables me to preserve context for new chats so that I don't have to worry about long running chats exhausting a workflow.
