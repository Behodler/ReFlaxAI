# Test Results Summary

This file contains the latest test run results for the ReFlax project.

## Migration Stress Test - COMPLETED ✅

### Final Status: All Tests Passing ✅
- **File**: `test-integration/vault/Migration.integration.t.sol`
- **Test Results**: 6/6 tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Implementation**: Complete with comprehensive test coverage

### Test Scenarios (All Passing ✅)
1. **testBasicMigration**: ✅ PASS - Basic migration between two yield sources
2. **testMultiUserMigration**: ✅ PASS - Migration with multiple users and varying balances  
3. **testMigrationWithAccumulatedRewards**: ✅ PASS - Migration with rewards accumulated over time
4. **testMigrationWithLossHandling**: ✅ PASS - Migration with loss/surplus handling
5. **testEmergencyPauseDuringMigration**: ✅ PASS - Emergency state during migration scenarios
6. **testPostMigrationOperations**: ✅ PASS - All operations work correctly post-migration

### Technical Implementation - COMPLETED ✅
- **CVX_CRV_YieldSource Integration**: Complete with all 14 required parameters
- **Mock Infrastructure**: Comprehensive mock ecosystem including:
  - MockConvexBooster with multi-pool support
  - MockConvexRewardPool with mock reward tokens
  - MockCurvePool for liquidity operations
  - MockUniswapV3Router for token swaps with proper interface
  - MockOracle and MockPriceTilter with correct token handling
- **Vault Configuration**: TestVault with proper yield source migration support
- **Method Signatures**: All Vault method calls corrected (withdraw, claimRewards with proper parameters)

### Issues Fixed During Implementation ✅
1. **MockUniswapV3Router Interface**: Fixed to match IUniswapV3Router.ExactInputSingleParams structure
2. **Token Transfer Logic**: Fixed USDC vs mock token handling in router
3. **LP Token Approvals**: Added missing approvals for LP tokens to Curve pools  
4. **Balance Management**: Ensured mock contracts have sufficient token balances
5. **Reward Transfer Bug**: Fixed missing transfer in AYieldSource.claimAndSellForInputToken()
6. **totalDeposits Tracking**: Fixed vault to track input token amounts instead of LP amounts during migration
7. **Test Assertions**: Updated to account for reward conversions to USDC
8. **Emergency State Logic**: Fixed test sequence to properly handle emergency state restrictions

### Source Code Improvements Made ✅
- **AYieldSource.sol**: Added missing `inputToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, inputTokenAmount)` in `claimAndSellForInputToken()` 
- **Vault.sol**: Fixed migration logic to track input token amounts in `totalDeposits` instead of LP amounts

### Integration Coverage Achieved ✅
The Migration Stress Test provides comprehensive coverage of:
- Multi-user migration scenarios with proper balance preservation
- Reward accumulation and conversion during migration  
- Loss/surplus handling mechanisms with accounting accuracy
- Emergency state management with proper access controls
- Post-migration operation verification ensuring full functionality
- Complex yield source transitions with mock protocol interactions
