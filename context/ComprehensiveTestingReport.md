## 1. Testing Methodology Overview

### 1.1 Multi-Layered Approach
ReFlax employs a defense-in-depth strategy with four complementary testing layers:

1. **Unit Testing**: Component-level functionality validation
2. **Integration Testing**: Real-world scenario simulation
3. **Mutation Testing**: Test suite robustness verification
4. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical correctness proofs

### 1.2 Coverage Philosophy
Rather than pursuing arbitrary coverage metrics, ReFlax focuses on:
- Critical path coverage for financial operations

- `YieldSource_Enhanced.spec`: State consistency and array integrity
- Result: Future mutations would be caught by both tests AND proofs

### 6.3 Defense-in-Depth Achieved
Multiple detection layers for each vulnerability class:
1. Unit tests catch specific instances
2. Integration tests validate scenarios
3. Mutation tests ensure test robustness
4. Formal verification proves universal properties
