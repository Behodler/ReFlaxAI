# Current Story Template

## Purpose of This Template

This template file provides the structure for creating CurrentStory.md - a dynamic planning and execution space for the next major task or feature being tackled in the ReFlax project. Copy this template to CurrentStory.md when starting new work. It's designed to help Claude Code agents understand:

1. **What we're working on right now** - The current focus area or task
2. **Why it matters** - The business/technical justification for prioritizing this work
3. **The plan** - A detailed breakdown of steps, requirements, and success criteria
4. **Progress tracking** - What's been done, what's in progress, and what's next
5. **Context and constraints** - Important background information, dependencies, and limitations

## How to Use This File

**For Project Maintainers:**
- Copy this template to CurrentStory.md when starting a new major task or feature
- Keep CurrentStory.md current as work progresses
- Use it to communicate priorities and context to future AI agents

**For Claude Code Agents:**
- Read CurrentStory.md early in any conversation to understand current priorities
- Use the information there to guide decisions about what to work on
- Update progress sections in CurrentStory.md as you complete tasks
- Ask clarifying questions if the current story is unclear or incomplete

## Current Story Status

**Status**: No active story - ready for next assignment

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-13
