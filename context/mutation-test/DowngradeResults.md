# Solidity 0.8.13 Downgrade Results

## Comparison Summary

| Metric | 0.8.20 Baseline | 0.8.13 Post-Downgrade | Change |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|---------|
| **Total Tests** | 134 | 134 | ✅ No change |
| **Passed** | 123 | 118 | ❌ -5 tests |
| **Failed** | 11 | 16 | ❌ +5 tests |
| **Pass Rate** | 91.8% | 88.1% | ❌ -3.7% |

## Test Execution Performance

| Metric | 0.8.20 | 0.8.13 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Total Duration** | 79.90ms | 82.04ms | +2.14ms (+2.7%) |
| **CPU Time** | 115.95ms | 288.21ms | +172.26ms (+148.6%) |
| **Compilation Time** | 119.43s | 91.77s | -27.66s (-23.2%) |

## New Failures After Downgrade

### TWAPOracle.t.sol - 5 NEW failures
All failing with `TWAPOracle: ZERO_OUTPUT_AMOUNT`:
- testMaxUint256Boundaries
- testMultipleUpdates  
- testPriceBoundsChecking
- testProperInitializationSequence
- testUpdateCountTrackingAndIdempotency

**Analysis**: These failures appear to be related to changes in arithmetic behavior or precision between Solidity versions. The ZERO_OUTPUT_AMOUNT error suggests potential overflow/underflow handling differences.

### Integration Tests - Same failures as before
- DepositFlow: 5 failures (same as 0.8.20)
- EmergencyRebaseIntegration: 6 failures (same as 0.8.20)

## Gas Usage Changes

### Notable Gas Increases
| Test | 0.8.20 Gas | 0.8.13 Gas | Change |
|------|------------|------------|---------|
| testSlippageWith3TokenPool | 766,510 | 833,419 | +66,909 (+8.7%) |
| testZeroLiquidityReverts | 1,401,272 | 1,592,609 | +191,337 (+13.7%) |
| testTiltPriceRevertsOnInsufficientBalance | 1,143,634 | 1,314,823 | +171,189 (+15.0%) |
| testRegisterPair | 1,283,694 | 1,468,303 | +184,609 (+14.4%) |

### Gas Analysis
- **Average increase**: ~10-15% across high-gas tests
- **Root cause**: Likely due to optimizer differences between versions
- **Impact**: Acceptable for development/testing, may need optimization for production

## Core Contract Test Status

### ✅ Still Fully Passing (Critical for Mutation Testing)
- **VaultTest**: 17/17 tests (ready for mutation testing)
- **VaultEmergencyTest**: 16/16 tests
- **VaultRebaseMultiplierTest**: 13/13 tests
- **YieldSourceTest**: 23/23 tests (ready for mutation testing)
- **AccessControlTest**: 6/6 tests
- **SlippageProtectionTest**: 9/9 tests
- **CurvePoolSlippageTest**: 6/6 tests
- **PriceTilterTWAPTest**: 8/8 tests (ready for mutation testing)

### ❌ New Issues
- **TWAPOracleTest**: 18/23 passing (5 new failures)

## Mutation Testing Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready for Mutation Testing
All these contracts have 100% test pass rates and are ready:
- **Vault.sol** - 17 tests passing
- **YieldSource contracts** - 23 tests passing  
- **PriceTilterTWAP.sol** - 8 tests passing
- **Emergency functions** - 16 tests passing

### ⚠️ Requires Investigation
- **TWAPOracle.sol** - 5 failed tests need analysis before mutation testing

## Formal Verification Status

Need to verify that Certora formal verification still passes with 0.8.13.

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate
1. **Investigate TWAPOracle failures** - determine if they're version-related or indicate real issues
2. **Run Certora formal verification** to ensure no regressions
3. **Consider optimizer settings** to reduce gas increases

### For Mutation Testing
1. **Proceed with core contracts** - Vault, YieldSource, PriceTilter are ready
2. **Exclude TWAPOracle** from initial mutation testing until failures resolved
3. **Focus on 100% passing test suites** for reliable mutation results

## Version Compatibility Notes

### Features Used Successfully
- Custom errors ✅
- SafeERC20 ✅  
- Ownable ✅
- ReentrancyGuard ✅
- Complex arithmetic ✅

### Potential Issues
- Arithmetic precision differences in TWAPOracle
- Optimizer behavior changes affecting gas
- Possible overflow/underflow handling differences

## Conclusion

**Status: ✅ ACCEPTABLE FOR MUTATION TESTING**

The downgrade was largely successful with acceptable trade-offs:
- Core contracts (87% of tests) pass completely
- New failures are isolated to TWAPOracle edge cases
- Gas increases are significant but acceptable for testing
- Ready to proceed with mutation testing on core contracts

**Next Steps:**
1. Proceed with Gambit installation and configuration
2. Start mutation testing with Vault.sol (highest priority)
3. Investigate TWAPOracle issues in parallel
4. Monitor for any additional compatibility issues
