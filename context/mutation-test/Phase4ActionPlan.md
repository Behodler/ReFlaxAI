# Phase 4 Action Plan - Structured Mutation Testing Completion

## Executive Summary

This action plan addresses the need for organized mutation testing progression, avoiding noise over signal, and preparing for comprehensive updates to the formal verification report once mutation testing is complete.

## Key Directives from User Feedback

1. **Organization**: Create a clear directory structure for tracking mutation testing evolution
2. **Documentation**: Enable future agents to parse progression and create accurate narratives
3. **Efficiency**: Avoid wasting time on pointless mutants (e.g., OpenZeppelin ownership code)
4. **Reporting**: Hold off on updating ComprehensiveFormalVerificationReport.md until mutation testing is complete
5. **Focus**: Prioritize signal over noise - target meaningful mutations only

## Phase 4 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update CLAUDE.md for Continuity
- Update `context/mutation-test/CLAUDE.md` with navigation guide
- Document the Phase 4 Action Plan location and purpose
- Ensure fresh agents can pick up work if interrupted
- Include mutation filtering philosophy and directory structure

### Step 2: Organize Existing Work
- Create the directory structure above
- Move existing mutation testing files to appropriate locations
- Create summary.md files for each contract documenting the progression

### Step 3: Smart Mutation Selection
**Criteria for EXCLUDING mutations:**
- OpenZeppelin library code (well-tested, battle-hardened)
- View functions with no state changes
- Getter functions that only return values
- Inherited standard functions (ERC20, Ownable basics)
- Equivalent mutations that don't change behavior

**Criteria for PRIORITIZING mutations:**
- Custom business logic unique to ReFlax
- Financial calculations (deposits, withdrawals, rewards)
- DeFi integration points (Uniswap, Curve, Convex interactions)
- Price calculations and oracle interactions
- Emergency functions and access control on critical operations
- State-changing functions with complex logic

### Step 4: Efficient Mutation Testing Execution

#### For Vault Contract:
1. Filter out ~50-80 OpenZeppelin ownership mutations
2. Focus on the ~180-200 ReFlax-specific mutations
3. Run targeted testing on high-value mutations only
4. Document which mutation categories were excluded and why

#### For YieldSource Contracts:
1. Prioritize DeFi integration mutations (Uniswap swaps, Curve deposits)
2. Skip standard access control patterns
3. Focus on ~200-250 protocol-specific mutations

#### For PriceTilter:
1. Target price calculation and liquidity addition mutations
2. Skip view functions and simple getters
3. Focus on ~80-100 core logic mutations

#### For TWAPOracle:
1. Focus on time calculations and price update logic
2. Skip basic ownership mutations
3. Target ~70-90 oracle-specific mutations

### Step 5: Documentation Standards

Each phase directory should contain:
- `mutation-results.json` - Raw results from mutation testing
- `surviving-mutants.md` - Analysis of why mutants survived
- `tests-added.md` - What tests were added and why
- `improvement-metrics.md` - Before/after mutation scores

### Step 6: Execution Timeline

**Week 1:**
- Reorganize existing files into new structure
- Complete Vault mutation testing with smart filtering
- Document excluded mutation categories

**Week 2:**
- YieldSource contracts mutation testing
- PriceTilter mutation testing
- Continue documentation

**Week 3:**
- TWAPOracle mutation testing (if specs fixed)
- Compile final metrics
- Prepare comprehensive update for formal verification report

### Step 7: Final Report Integration

**ONLY after all mutation testing is complete:**
1. Update `ComprehensiveFormalVerificationReport.md` with final, verified results
2. Include mutation testing methodology and exclusions
3. Present final mutation scores with context
4. Maintain professional narrative without backtracking

## Important Notes

### DO NOT Update ComprehensiveFormalVerificationReport.md Until:
- All contracts have completed mutation testing
- Final scores are verified and stable
- Exclusion methodology is documented
- Results tell a coherent, forward-moving story

### Signal vs Noise Philosophy:
- Every mutation we test should teach us something valuable
- Time spent on OpenZeppelin mutations is time wasted
- Focus on mutations that could reveal ReFlax-specific vulnerabilities
- Quality over quantity in mutation killing

### Future Agent Guidance:
- Check phase directories in chronological order
- Read summary.md files for quick context
- Understand exclusions before interpreting scores
- Use evolution documentation to craft accurate narratives

## Success Metrics

1. **Meaningful Coverage**: 85%+ mutation score on ReFlax-specific code
2. **Efficiency**: <500 total mutations tested (vs 875 generated)
3. **Documentation**: Clear progression narrative for each contract
4. **Time**: Complete Phase 4 in 3 weeks or less
5. **Quality**: No time wasted on pointless mutations

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Update `context/mutation-test/CLAUDE.md` with Phase 4 navigation guide and action plan reference
2. Create directory structure as outlined
3. Move existing files to appropriate locations
4. Write Vault contract summary.md documenting phases 1-3
5. Begin smart filtering of Vault mutations for phase 4 execution
6. Document excluded mutation categories with rationale
