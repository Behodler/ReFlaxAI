## Recommendations for DApp Developers

### 🔧 **Integration Guidelines**

#### **Safe Integration Patterns**
```solidity
// ✅ Safe: Check return values
uint256 flaxReward = vault.claimRewards();
require(flaxReward > 0, "No rewards available");

// ✅ Safe: Respect access control
require(vault.canWithdraw(user), "Withdrawal restricted");
```

#### **Operational Best Practices**
1. **Monitor surplus levels** in Vaults to ensure adequate withdrawal buffers
2. **Set conservative parameters** during initial deployment phases
3. **Implement circuit breakers** for unusual activity patterns
4. **Regular reconciliation** of internal accounting vs external protocol balances

### 📊 **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

#### **For DApp Integrators**
- **Gradual Rollout**: Start with smaller deposit limits and increase based on observed behavior
- **Multi-Sig Security**: Use multi-signature wallets for all owner functions
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Implement real-time monitoring for edge cases identified in verification
- **Contingency Planning**: Prepare procedures for emergency scenarios

#### **For End Users**
- **Diversification**: Don't deposit 100% of funds in a single vault
- **Understand Risks**: Be aware of impermanent loss and DeFi protocol risks
- **Monitor Surplus**: Check vault surplus levels before large withdrawals
