# Current Story: Fix Gas Integration Tests

## Story Overview
**Title**: Debug and fix failing gas integration tests  
**Type**: Bug Fix  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅  
**Date**: 2025-06-15

## Problem Statement
The gas integration tests were failing with "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance" error when running `testGenerateGasReport`. This function runs all individual gas tests sequentially, causing account balances to be depleted by the time later tests execute.

## Root Cause Analysis
- `testGenerateGasReport` calls all individual test functions in sequence
- Each test consumes tokens from test accounts (USDC, sFlax, ETH)
- By the time later tests run, accounts have insufficient balances
- This caused the "transfer amount exceeds balance" error

## Solution Implemented
Added balance reset logic at the beginning of `testGenerateGasReport` to restore all test account balances before running the sequential tests.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `test-integration/gas/GasOptimization.integration.t.sol`
  - Added balance reset logic in `testGenerateGasReport`
  - Ensures accounts have sufficient USDC, ETH, and sFlax tokens

### Key Changes
```solidity
function testGenerateGasReport() public {
    // Reset account balances before running all tests
    dealUSDC(alice, 100000 * 1e6);    // 100k USDC
    dealUSDC(bob, 50000 * 1e6);       // 50k USDC  
    dealUSDC(charlie, 10000 * 1e6);   // 10k USDC
    dealETH(alice, 10 ether);
    dealETH(bob, 10 ether);
    dealETH(charlie, 10 ether);
    
    // Reset sFlax balances
    sFlaxToken.mint(alice, 10000 * 1e18);
    sFlaxToken.mint(bob, 5000 * 1e18);
    
    // Run all gas measurements...
}
```

## Test Results
- **Gas Integration Tests**: 21/21 tests passing (100% success rate)
  - `GasOptimization.integration.t.sol`: 11/11 tests passing
  - `GasOptimizationSimple.integration.t.sol`: 10/10 tests passing
- **Full Integration Suite**: 81/81 tests passing
- Successfully generates comprehensive gas optimization report

## Gas Measurements Summary
| Operation | Gas Used | Cost at 0.01 Gwei |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Small Deposit (1k USDC) | 172,129 | $0.006 |
| Medium Deposit (10k USDC) | 87,329 | $0.003 |
| Large Deposit (50k USDC) | 65,429 | $0.002 |
| Claim Rewards | 39,344 | $0.001 |
| Full Withdrawal | 77,388 | $0.003 |
| Migration | 159,584 | $0.006 |
| Price Tilting | 253,404 | $0.009 |

### Conservative Estimate
- **500k gas transaction**: 0.000005 ETH ≈ $0.0175 (1.75 cents)

## Technical Architecture
The tests use a mock-based approach to isolate gas measurements:
- **MockTWAPOracle**: Bypasses complex oracle dependencies
- **MockYieldSource**: Simplified yield source without Curve/Convex
- **MockFlaxToken**: ERC20 with mint/burn capabilities
- **TestVault**: Concrete implementation of abstract Vault

## Completion Checklist
- [x] Identify root cause of test failures
- [x] Implement balance reset fix
- [x] Verify all gas tests pass individually
- [x] Verify testGenerateGasReport passes
- [x] Run full integration test suite
- [x] Update documentation (TestLog.md)
- [x] Update CurrentStory.md
- [ ] Commit and push changes

## Story Status: COMPLETED ✅
All gas integration tests are now passing and providing reliable, reproducible gas measurements for the ReFlax protocol. The fix ensures that sequential test execution doesn't cause balance depletion issues.
