# Feature Development CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working on new features in the ReFlax protocol.

## Overview

Feature development follows a structured approach using CurrentStory.md to track progress and maintain context across sessions.

## Key Files in This Directory

- `CurrentStory.md` - The active story/feature being worked on
- `CurrentStoryTemplate.md` - Template to copy when starting new work
- `Backlog.md` - Future features and improvements
- `WorkflowRules.md` - Rules for feature development workflow

## Quick Start

When starting a new feature:
1. Copy `CurrentStoryTemplate.md` to `CurrentStory.md`
2. Fill in the story details, background, success criteria, and plan
3. Follow the workflow rules in `WorkflowRules.md`
4. Update progress in `CurrentStory.md` as you work

## Important Reminders

- Always start by populating CurrentStory.md from the template
- Clear TestLog.md before beginning a new feature
- Create and check off a checklist as you progress
- Update architecture documentation when making significant changes
- Run all tests and update TestLog.md when completing the feature

## Current Status

Check `CurrentStory.md` to see what's currently being worked on. If it shows "No active story - ready for next assignment", then a new feature can be started.
