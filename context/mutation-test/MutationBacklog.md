# Mutation Testing Backlog and TODOs

## Immediate Tasks (Before First Run)

### 1. Solidity Downgrade
- [ ] Create baseline test results with 0.8.20
- [ ] Document current gas usage
- [ ] Execute downgrade to 0.8.13
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Compare gas usage pre/post downgrade

### 2. Gambit Installation
- [ ] Install Gambit version 0.4.0
- [ ] Verify installation with --version
- [ ] Test basic mutation generation
- [ ] Configure .gambit.yml file

### 3. Initial Setup
- [ ] Create mutation-reports directory
- [ ] Set up .gitignore entries for Gambit artifacts
- [ ] Create initial baseline mutation run
- [ ] Document initial mutation scores

## Short-term Improvements (Week 1-2)

### Test Suite Optimization
- [ ] Identify slow tests that may cause timeouts
- [ ] Create test groups for parallel execution
- [ ] Optimize integration tests for mutation testing
- [ ] Create mutation-specific test profile in foundry.toml

### Contract Prioritization
- [ ] Complete mutation testing for Vault.sol
- [ ] Analyze and fix survived mutations in Vault.sol
- [ ] Move to YieldSource contracts
- [ ] Document equivalent mutations found

### Documentation
- [ ] Create mutation testing best practices guide
- [ ] Document common survived mutation patterns
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add examples of test improvements

## Medium-term Goals (Month 1)

### Coverage Improvements
- [ ] Achieve 90% mutation score on Vault.sol
- [ ] Achieve 85% mutation score on YieldSource contracts
- [ ] Complete initial mutation testing on all contracts
- [ ] Create test improvement plan based on results

### Workflow Integration
- [ ] Create pre-commit hook for changed files
- [ ] Integrate mutation testing into PR workflow
- [ ] Set up automated weekly mutation runs
- [ ] Create mutation score tracking dashboard

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement incremental mutation testing
- [ ] Optimize Gambit configuration for speed
- [ ] Create contract-specific timeout settings
- [ ] Implement smart test selection

## Long-term Vision (Month 2-3)

### Advanced Analysis
- [ ] Correlate mutation results with audit findings
- [ ] Cross-reference with formal verification gaps
- [ ] Identify patterns in survived mutations
- [ ] Create mutation-based security checklist

### Automation
- [ ] Fully automated mutation testing in CI
- [ ] Automatic issue creation for survived mutations
- [ ] Mutation score trending and alerts
- [ ] Integration with code review process

### Knowledge Sharing
- [ ] Create internal mutation testing workshop
- [ ] Document case studies of bugs found
- [ ] Share learnings with broader DeFi community
- [ ] Contribute improvements back to Gambit

## Technical Debt

### Known Issues
1. **Timeout Configuration**: Need to tune timeouts per contract size
2. **Memory Usage**: Large contracts may need splitting
3. **Equivalent Mutations**: Need systematic way to track
4. **Test Naming**: Inconsistent naming makes smart selection harder

### Refactoring Needs
1. **Test Organization**: Group tests by contract for better selection
2. **Mock Simplification**: Complex mocks slow down mutation testing
3. **Integration Test Isolation**: Better isolation for faster runs
4. **Helper Functions**: Reduce duplication in test helpers

## Research Topics

### Mutation Operators
- [ ] Research DeFi-specific mutation operators
- [ ] Evaluate custom operator implementation
- [ ] Study SafeMath-aware mutations
- [ ] Investigate assembly code mutations

### Integration Possibilities
- [ ] Slither integration for smart mutations
- [ ] Echidna property testing correlation
- [ ] Formal verification spec generation
- [ ] AI-assisted test generation for survivors

## Metrics to Track

### Primary Metrics
1. Overall mutation score
2. Contract-specific scores
3. Operator effectiveness
4. Test execution time

### Secondary Metrics
1. Mutations per line of code
2. Test efficiency (mutations killed per test)
3. Equivalent mutation ratio
4. Performance degradation over time

## Resource Requirements

### Time Estimates
- Initial setup: 4-6 hours
- First complete run: 2-3 hours
- Weekly maintenance: 1-2 hours
- Per-PR checks: 15-30 minutes

### Computational Resources
- CPU: 4+ cores recommended
- RAM: 8GB minimum, 16GB preferred
- Disk: 2GB for artifacts and reports
- Network: For downloading dependencies

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 (Setup)
- ✅ All tests pass on Solidity 0.8.13
- ✅ Gambit successfully installed
- ✅ Initial mutation run completed
- ✅ Documentation complete

### Phase 2 (Implementation)
- [ ] 80% overall mutation score
- [ ] 90% score on critical contracts
- [ ] <5 minute run time for PR checks
- [ ] Zero high-impact survivors

### Phase 3 (Maturity)
- [ ] Fully automated workflow
- [ ] Consistent 85%+ scores
- [ ] Team trained on mutation testing
- [ ] Regular improvement cycle

## Notes and Ideas

### Experimental Features
1. **Mutation Testing Games**: Compete to write tests that kill mutations
2. **Mutation of Tests**: Ensure tests themselves are robust
3. **Cross-Contract Mutations**: Test integration points
4. **Time-Travel Mutations**: Test time-dependent logic

### Integration Ideas
1. Link mutation results to code review comments
2. Auto-generate test stubs for survived mutations
3. Create mutation "heat map" visualization
4. Build mutation-based code complexity metrics

### Community Contributions
1. Share Gambit configuration templates
2. Create DeFi mutation operator library
3. Publish mutation testing case studies
4. Contribute to Gambit documentation
